However, if you don't have a subscription to CBT Nuggets, or you want to watch the videos offline, you may be wondering how to download the course from the internet. In this article, we will show you some ways to do that using torrent files and magnet links.
 
## What are torrent files and magnet links?
 
Torrent files and magnet links are two ways to share files over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is a decentralized system where users can exchange files directly with each other, without relying on a central server. This makes file sharing faster and more efficient, as well as more resistant to censorship and shutdowns.
 
A torrent file is a small file that contains information about the files you want to download, such as their names, sizes, and locations on the P2P network. You need a torrent client software, such as qBittorrent or uTorrent, to open a torrent file and start downloading the files.
 
A magnet link is a URL that contains the same information as a torrent file, but encoded in a string of characters. You can copy and paste a magnet link into your torrent client software, or click on it if your browser supports it, and start downloading the files without needing a torrent file.
 
## How to download CBT Nuggets CCNA Security 210-260 course using torrent files and magnet links?
 
There are many websites that offer torrent files and magnet links for various files, including CBT Nuggets courses. However, not all of them are reliable or safe. Some may contain malware, viruses, or fake files that can harm your computer or waste your bandwidth. Therefore, you should always be careful when downloading files from unknown sources.
 
One of the websites that seems to have a torrent file and a magnet link for the CBT Nuggets CCNA Security 210-260 course is BT4G[^1^]. This website claims to be a meta-search engine that collects torrent metadata from various sources. However, we cannot guarantee its authenticity or safety. Use it at your own risk.
 
To download the course from BT4G, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [https://bt4g.org](https://bt4g.org) and type "CBT Nuggets CCNA Security 210-260" in the search box.
2. Click on the result that says "CBT Nuggets CCNA Security 210-260 Torrent download".
3. You will see a page with some information about the course, such as its file size, seeders, leechers, and updated date. Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Leechers are users who are downloading the file but have not completed it yet. The more seeders and leechers there are, the faster the download speed will be.
4. You will also see two options to download the course: "Download Magnet link" or "Torrent download". You can choose either one depending on your preference. If you choose "Download Magnet link", you will need to copy and paste the link into your torrent client software. If you choose "Torrent download", you will need to download the torrent file and open it with your torrent client software.
5. Once you have added the torrent file or magnet link to your torrent client software, you will see the list of files that are included in the course. You can select which ones you want to download or deselect the ones you don't need.
6. Wait for the download to finish. Depending on your internet speed and the availability of seeders and leechers, this may take some time.
7. Enjoy watching the videos offline!
